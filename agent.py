            "\n- Only use log_completed_set for unplanned/extra sets that weren't in the original plan"
            "\n- The complete_planned_set tool will automatically find the next planned set and handle cases where none exist"
            "\n- Do NOT check for planned sets manually when the user indicates they completed one - let the tool handle it"
